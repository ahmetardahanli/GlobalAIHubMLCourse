    "Basically there are two ways to handle missing values:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Deleting:__ In this way, we remove the row that has a missing value for a feature. This method is recommended if we have enough samples.\n",
    "- __Filling with mean, mode or median:__ This method is useful for features having numerical data. We calculate mean, mode or median of a feature and fill missing values with that result value. \n",

    "\n",
    "Outliers are extreme values that deviate from other observations on data , they may indicate a variability in a measurement, experimental errors or a novelty. In other words, an outlier is an observation that diverges from an overall pattern on a sample. Outliers in a data set may be caused by many reasons like data entry errors, measurement errors etc.\n",
